1. Stock Price Prediction using RNN(LSTM) 

•	Predicted Google stock price of Jan 2017 by training model on dataset of Google stock price from 2013 to 2016.

•	Built 5 layers model: 4 LSTM layers, a dense layer, using Keras

•	Prediction results reflected the similar change and trend as the real stock price data in that period.


2. Bank Note Authentication using Random forest | Simon Frasor University	  Nov 2020

•	Applied Random Forest algorithm to predict the bank note is genuine or fake.

•	Developed web application accepting input from users and showing prediction result, using scikit, streamlit, Docker
