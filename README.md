### Stock Price Prediction using RNN(LSTM) 

   1. Predicted Google stock price of Jan 2017 by training model on dataset of Google stock price from 2013 to 2016.
   2. Built 5 layers model: 4 LSTM layers, a dense layer, using Keras.
   3. Prediction results reflected the similar change and trend as the real stock price data in that period.
